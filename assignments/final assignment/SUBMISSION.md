# Final Project Reflection:

Working on our Recipe App taught me a lot. 

## My Role (Member 1 – Frontend):

- Made responsive layouts with Bootstrap and custom CSS  
- Styled pages for a dark theme with glow effects  
- Added hover effects, loading spinners, and simple form validation in JS  

## Team Roles:

- **Member 2:** Recipe CRUD, search, ratings, comments  
  (`routes/recipes.js`, `models/Recipe.js`, `models/Comment.js`, `utils/validation.js`)  
- **Member 3:** User signup/login, profiles, file uploads  
  (`routes/users.js`, `models/User.js`, auth middleware)  
- **Member 4:** Server setup, database config, API routes, error handling  
  (`app.js`, `config/db.js`, `routes/api/index.js`, etc.)  

## Key Things I Learned:

1. **Responsive Design:** Used Flexbox/Grid and Bootstrap so it looks good everywhere.  
2. **Templates with Pug:** Reused navbar/footer code to keep things DRY.  
3. **Front‑End JS:** Simple form checks and async UI (disable buttons, show spinners).  
4. **Git Workflow:** Branches, pull requests, clear commits, and merging.  
5. **Team Communication:** Daily check‑ins kept us on track and solved issues fast.  

This project showed me how the front end fits into a full‑stack app—and why teamwork matters.
